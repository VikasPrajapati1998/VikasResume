4. **Version Control Systems**: Familiarity with Git or SVN for version control and collaboration.

5. **Frontend Technologies**: Basic understanding of frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to collaborate effectively with frontend developers.

6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Strong understanding and application of OOP concepts in Python.

7. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Knowledge of fundamental data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) and algorithms for efficient problem-solving.

8. **Debugging and Testing**: Proficiency in debugging Python applications and writing unit tests using frameworks like unittest or pytest.

9. **API Integration**: Experience in integrating third-party APIs and web services.

10. **Concurrency and Asynchronous Programming**: Understanding of concurrency issues and experience with asynchronous programming using async/await.

11. **Deployment and DevOps**: Basic knowledge of containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).

### Soft Skills:

1. **Problem-Solving**: Ability to analyze problems and propose multiple solutions with a focus on efficiency and scalability.

2. **Team Collaboration**: Experience working in Agile teams, participating in code reviews, and effectively communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

3. **Time Management**: Efficiently managing workload and meeting deadlines in a fast-paced development environment.

4. **Continuous Learning**: Commitment to staying updated with the latest technologies, tools, and best practices in Python development.

5. **Adaptability**: Ability to quickly learn new frameworks or technologies as required by the project.
